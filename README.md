# Rustentia

This is a flashcards application written in Rust with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)
using [rusqlite](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite) for making and managing the database.

## About

This is a practise project I made while learning programming and Rust,
it hasn't been well tested and is missing quite a few features compared to
other such applications.
